 Java Program to Demonstrate Error When Declaring Local Variable as Static

 Description:
 In Java, local variables cannot be declared `static
 because they belong to the methodâ€™s stack frame, which is created and destroyed per method call.
 A `static` variable belongs to the class and has a lifetime equal to the program
 Mixing these two scopes causes conflict, so Java forbids it. |
