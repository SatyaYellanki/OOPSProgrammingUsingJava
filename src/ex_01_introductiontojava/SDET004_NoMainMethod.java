/**
 * Why?

main(String[] args) is the entry point for normal Java applications.

Without it, the JVM doesn’t know where to start execution.

That’s why we need at least one main() method if we want to run a class directly.

But remember:
You can still use this class without a main method if it’s just holding methods or fields that are used by another class
For example:
public class SDET004_NoMainMethod {
    public static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from SDET004_NoMainMethod!");
    }
}
 */

public class SDET004_NoMainMethod {

}
